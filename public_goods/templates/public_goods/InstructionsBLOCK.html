        In this study, you will be in a randomly formed group
        of <b>{{ Constants.players_per_group }}</b> participants. Each participant in
        the group is given <strong>{{ Constants.endowment}}</strong>. The group
        has the opportunity to undertake a joint project. Each participant in
        the group decides how much she or he is going to contribute to
        the project. Contribution could be any integer from <strong>0
        to {{ Constants.endowment}}</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The earnings from the project are calculated as follows: The
        contributions of all <strong>{{ Constants.players_per_group }}</strong> participants are
        added up, the total contribution
        is multiplied by a factor of <strong>{{ Constants.coefficient }}</strong>, and the
        resulting amount is the total earnings from the project, which is
        evenly split among all <strong>{{ Constants.players_per_group }}</strong>
        participants. Your payoff equals your earnings from the project, plus
        the amount you did not contribute.
